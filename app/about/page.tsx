                  Hello everyone! I am Anika Schoolland, and I have a small business called ClayHouse Pottery. I was
                  able to take pottery lessons in 2019 through a once a week class at the Chartreuse Muse in Modesto
                  when I was in eighth grade. I was very excited and inspired by the class and desired more time to
                  create. My parents found me a kick wheel for Christmas and I took off on it. I spend most of my time
                  during the summer on the wheel whether I'm teaching classes or making pottery myself. One of my
                  favorite projects when I was younger was building a playhouse in our backyard. Dad and I remodeled it
                  into the pottery studioâ€¦ From PlayHouse to ClayHouse. While I have recently moved out of the backyard
                  studio into my grandfather's shop so I can make pottery year round, the story of PlayHouse to
                  ClayHouse lives on.
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-clay-primary leading-relaxed">
                  My mission is to make functional art as a co-creator with God, The Creator, for His glory; remembering
                  that,
                  {
                    '"You, O Lord, are our Father; we are the clay, and You are our Potter; we are all the work of Your hand."'
                  }

                    One of my favorite childhood projects was building a playhouse in our backyard. Years later, Dad and
                    I transformed that same playhouse into my pottery studio. It's such a special space - from a place
                    where I played as a child to where I now create art as a young adult. The transformation from
                    PlayHouse to ClayHouse represents my own journey of growth and passion.

                    Every piece I create in this studio carries that history and love. It's not just a workspace; it's
                    where dreams take shape, literally and figuratively.
